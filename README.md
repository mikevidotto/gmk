# gmk

A minimal command-line tool to instantly create and open a new Go `main.go` file with a starter template.

## Usage

```bash
gmk

Running `gmk` will:

- Create a `main.go` file (if one doesn't already exist).
- Populate it with a basic Go template.
- Open the file in your favourite editor (its Neovim btw).
